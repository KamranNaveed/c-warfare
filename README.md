C-WARFARE

On-the-console space invaders-esque game made as a semester project for Intro to Programming course in my university back in 2018. Written in C, without any graphic libraries (ASCII GUI, headache to build when you're new to programming). 

To-do:

- Logic and display bugs need to be fixed
- Improve UI
- Add more maps and game features

Executable uploaded for now can be directly run in the console. Will continue to update executable for people to play so they don't need to compile the code themselves. Dont worry, its not a virus :)

Takewayas:

Taking on this project in my intro to programming course, especially in a language like C, probably taught me more about coding than any other course during my time in university.
