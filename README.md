C-WARFARE

On-the-console space invaders-esque game made as a semester project for Intro to Programming course in my university back in 2018. Written in C, without any graphic libraries (Ascii GUI, headache to build when you're new to programming). 

To-do:

- Logic and display bugs need to be fixed
- Improve UI
- Add more maps and ga,e features
