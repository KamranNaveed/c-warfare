# C-WARFARE

On-the-console space invaders-esque game made as a semester project for Intro to Programming university course. Written in C, without the use of graphic libraries (ASCII GUI). 

## To-do:

- Logic and display bugs need to be fixed
- Improve UI
- Add more maps and game features

## Getting started

Obtain the exectuable by cloning the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/KamranNaveed/c-warfare.git
```
or by downloading the file

The exectuble can be run directly on your machine. I Will continue to update executable for people to play so they don't need to compile the code themselves.
